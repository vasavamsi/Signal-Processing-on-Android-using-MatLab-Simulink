# Signal-Processing-on-Android-using-MatLab-Simulink
This task is accompllished as a part of my assignment in the Course of Digital Signal Processing.

Problem Statement:-
Design an Android app on your phone which does the following [Group of TWO]:

- Establishes a TCP/IP or UDP network between two phones for transfer of data. One phone should act as a server and the other as a client.
- Plays a song (Song 1) on client phone in normal mode when you receive a command from the server phone and plays a low pass filtered version of the song when you shake the phone once. When you shake the phone again, the normal song (Song 1) is played.
- When you change teh location of the server phone, the song in the client should change from Song 1 to Song 2. A similar low pass filtered song (of Song 2) will be played when the phone is shook.
- Create an Youtube video (can set it in unlisted mode), and submit the link. Also upload your Simulink block.

The simlunk blocks are provided with the repo and the link to youtube video is as below:
